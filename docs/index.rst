Welcome to E7EPD Database's documentation!
==========================================

This is a electronics database specification, allowing you to store both parts and projects.

This project as a whole includes 3 components:

* E7EPD Database Specification: This is a document which describes the specification for
  storing part and project to the database.
* e7epd Python Package: This is the only officially supported method of creating the database and interacting with it.
* CLI Utility: This is a Python command line front-end for interacting with the e7epd Python Package.

The database specification will be separately revisioned from the CLI utility and Python package
